# giveaway-system

A giveaway system for individuals looking to distribute free items in an e-commerce-like workflow. Users can register, save shipping addresses, and place giveaway orders, while admins manage users, events, and orders from a simple admin dashboard. The project is intentionally lightweight and focuses on providing a usable, straightforward PHP/MySQL foundation that can be customized for different giveaway scenarios.

## Features
- User registration and authentication.
- Address management for recipients.
- Order submission and order history views.
- Basic order status tracking.
- Admin tools for managing users, events, and orders.

## Intended Use
This project is meant to be a practical starter for small-scale giveaway operations. It prioritizes clarity and simplicity so it can be adapted without heavy framework requirements.

## Disclaimer
The developer designed the overall framework and logic, but most of the coding was completed with assistance from Gemini and Codex. The developer is not a professional and only has a limited understanding of PHP; the goal is simply to provide something usable.
